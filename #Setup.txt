Setting Up (iOS):

*** This must be done for each project! ***

1. Make a virtual environment for your project.
- Create a project folder, cd into it, and install the environment within it using the following:
>>> python3 -m venv venv
- This will create a folder called "venv" within.

2. Activate the environment. (Make sure to include the dot in the beginning!)
>>> . venv/bin/activate
- The (venv) in the terminal indicates we are within the environment.
- Btw, the dot is a command "sources" the file, which allows the file (activate in this case) to make changes to the environment.

3. Install Flask within the project folder while within the environment.
>>> pip install Flask

4. This should be all you need to do. Follow the following link to create your first flask program: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/
